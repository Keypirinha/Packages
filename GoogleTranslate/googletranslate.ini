# IMPORTANT: it is recommended to check out the documentation of this package as
# it allows a special argument grammar to override the source and/or target
# language at search time, of each item defined here.

[defaults]

# The display name of the default item
# Default: Translate
#item_label = Translate

# The code of the default source language to assume if none is specified at
# search time
# * Refer to the bottom of this file or the documentation for an exhaustive list
#   of the language codes supported by Google Translate,
# * Default: auto
#input_lang = auto

# The code of the default target language to assume if none is specified at
# search time
# * Refer to the bottom of this file or the documentation for an exhaustive list
#   of the language codes supported by Google Translate,
# * Default: en
#output_lang = en

# Time that the plugin will wait before sending the request.
# * Time in seconds (can be used with float type)
# * The range of permissible values is [0.25, 3]
# * Default: 0.25
#idle_time = 0.25


# [custom_item/*] sections
#
# In addition to the default item, it is possible to define one or several extra
# items to insert into the Catalog, with different default source/target
# languages in case you often need to do translation fo.
#
# Note that this is useful only if you need them often. Otherwise, you might
# just want to use the special argument grammar detailed in the documentation.
#
# Examples:
#   [custom_item/ChineseToEnglish]
#   item_label = {default_item_label} from {input_lang_label} to {output_lang_label}
#   input_lang = zh-CN
#   output_lang = en
#
#   [custom_item/GermanToSpanish]
#   enable = no
#   item_label = Translate [{input_lang_code}:{output_lang_code}]
#   input_lang = de
#   output_lang = es
#
# Here are the properties of a custom item:
# * input_lang (required)
#     The code of the source language
# * output_lang (required)
#     The code of the target language
# * enable (optional)
#     Allows to disable this particular custom item (if "no"), in which case it
#     will not be inserted into the Catalog. A custom it em is enabled by
#     default (i.e. "yes").
# * item_label (optional)
#     Define the display name of this custom item.
#     In addition to the extrapolation mechanism, this value allows the
#     following placeholders:
#     * {section_name}
#         The name of the current section. For example, if the section is
#         [custom_item/ChineseToEnglish], the name is ChineseToEnglish.
#     * {default_item_label}
#         The item_label value of the default section will be inserted.
#         This is for convenience only since it is equivalent to the more
#         generic form: ${default_item:item_label}
#     * {input_lang_code}
#         The code of the specified source language.
#     * {input_lang_label}
#         The display name of the specified source language.
#     * {output_lang_code}
#         The code of the specified target language.
#     * {output_lang_label}
#         The display name of the specified target language.


[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.: "Keypirinha.ini") has
# already been made available to this file as well so you do not need to
# duplicate it here unless you want to override it.
#
# REMINDER: For convenience, Keypirinha silently populates this section with
# predefined values that may come handy. Here are some of them: APP_DIR,
# APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR, PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS,
# PROFILE_DIR_USER and the KNOWNFOLDER_* and KNOWNFOLDERGUID_* values.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.


[env]
# For convenience, Keypirinha populates this [env] section in every loaded
# configuration file so you can easily access to environment variables like
# PATH for example from this file using syntax: ${env:PATH}
#
# If an environment variable happens to be changed while Keypirinha is running
# and this modification impacts current configuration, application and packages
# configuration will be reloaded if needed only.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.
