[main]
# Plugin's main configuration section.

# Should typed URLs be kept in history?
# Default: yes
#keep_history = yes


[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.: "Keypirinha.ini") has
# already been made available to this file as well so you do not need to
# duplicate it here unless you want to override it.
#
# REMINDER: For convenience, Keypirinha silently populates this section with
# predefined values that may come handy. Here are some of them: APP_DIR,
# APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR, PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS,
# PROFILE_DIR_USER and the KNOWNFOLDER_* and KNOWNFOLDERGUID_* values.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.


[env]
# For convenience, Keypirinha populates this [env] section in every loaded
# configuration file so you can easily access to environment variables like
# PATH for example from this file using syntax: ${env:PATH}
#
# If an environment variable happens to be changed while Keypirinha is running
# and this modification impacts current configuration, application and packages
# configuration will be reloaded if needed only.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.
